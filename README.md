# Plenary meeting #

The Plenary meeting activity module organizes meetings following
tradional rules of parlimentary procedure. It may be used as a tool
to teach learners appropriate conduct in meeting or to structure and
administer facultly, staff, student or other organizational meetings.

Users are granted the privledges to speak, make motions, vote or chair
meetings through Moodle capabilities and roles. The activity maintains
a record of motions to provide meeting minutes. User actions are logged
in Moodle log system.

The activity can be used with an in person event or as an online
event. It has a integration with Deft response block to allow audio and
video to be shared based on whether the user is recognized to speak in
the activity. Other web conference or media servers also can be used as

provided for Jitsi meet.
